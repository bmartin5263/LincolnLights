# Lincoln Lights

## Phase 1 Goals

- [X] LED ring to replace the clock
  - [X] Arduino will be placed somewhere for easy access to load programs (OTA not required)
- [X] Arduino and LEDs will be powered by OBD-II adapter (5V)
- [X] Time between Arduino startup to the LEDs turning on should be low (maybe 1 second max)
- [X] Systems must be resilient to failure
- [X] Programmable Startup Animation
- [X] Multiple Scenes with ability to arbitrarily cycle between them

## Phase 2 Goals

- [ ] Smooth color changes when vehicle data changes abruptly
- [ ] Use the Lincoln clock's existing buttons for cycling scenes
- [ ] Multiple levels of brightness for different times of day
